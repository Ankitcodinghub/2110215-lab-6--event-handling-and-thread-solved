1. Problem Statement : Deserted Island Resident Service

You are a very famous freelance programmer now. One day, you have been contacted by a mysterious client who claims that he works for a large world-class megacompany.

The company itself just started the project called ‚ÄúDeserted Island Getaway Package‚Äù. It is a travel package that helps people relieve the stress from the everyday life. The client will get to live the full life on the Deserted Island, surrounded with nature.

However, there is a problem. As the numbers of the resident grows, the number of the task increases and harder to keep track of. So, they decided to build a database program to help assist with the process. Unfortunately, their last programmer went missing after a midnight stroll in a jungle last week and never came back, therefore you are tasked to finish the program.

Do note that the internet and server at the deserted island is very slow, so there will be a noticeable loading time for each data transmission.

1.1 Overview

This application contains two main parts, TableView that displays the data and the pane with two control buttons below. Initially, there will be no data loaded in the table, so you need to press ‚ÄúLoad More Tasks‚Äù first, where the program will gradually load up 3 more tasks.

For each task, there will be a ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button that you can click to start on a task. Once clicked, the button will turn into a progress bar and gradually filled up. It will turn into a Label once it finished. When the task is in progress, you can press another ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button from another task and it can be filled concurrently. However, if there is any task in progress, the control buttons at the bottom of the program will be disabled. Similarly, when you load in more tasks, the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button of each task will be disabled until it finished loading.

If the ‚ÄúClear Finished Tasks‚Äù button is pressed, it will clear out all the Finish tasks from the table. However, if there is no finished task, an error will be displayed instead.

Watch the Demo Footage Here: https://streamable.com/gnmgg6

Most of the Interface structures and logics such as data loading and progression have been provided. You only need to implement the functionality of the Program.

NOTE:

1. The interface of the program must be responsive all the time. You can still click the table during loading, for the example. Even when the button is disabled.

2. Thread.sleep commands have been used to simulate the real-life loading delay. Do not remove it or you will get 0 for this assignment.

3. Some parts of the program can be implemented without using thread, but you will not get any point from thread part.

4. Only important methods/fields will be shown below.

5. Feel free to create your own private methods/fields
